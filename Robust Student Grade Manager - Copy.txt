Robust Student Grade Manager:

You are building a small console program that:

Asks the user for a student name

Asks for a grade (0–100)

Validates the input

Prints the student’s grade

The program must not crash, even if the user enters invalid input.

Tasks:

Task 1: Handle Invalid Input
If the user enters non-numeric input for the grade, catch the exception and print:
Invalid input. Please enter a number.

Task 2: Validate Grade Range
Grades must be between 0 and 100
If not, throw an exception

Task 3: Create a Custom Exception
Create a custom exception called InvalidGradeException.

Task 4: Use finally
Ensure the scanner always closes.

Task 5: Prevent Program Crash
The program should never crash, regardless of input.

EXTENSION:
Loop until a valid input is entered
Store multiple students


STARTER CODE:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class StudentGradeManager {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter student name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter grade (0-100): ");
        int grade = scanner.nextInt(); // <-- may cause exception

        checkGrade(grade);

        System.out.println("Student " + name + " has grade " + grade);

        scanner.close();
    }

    public static void checkGrade(int grade) {
        // TODO: Validate grade
    }
}
