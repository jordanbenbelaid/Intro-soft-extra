Encapsulation:

Create a class called Vehicle

The class should contain:
	- at least 3 attributes in general of a vehicle, and an id for each vehicle (as an int)
	- a constructor with all attributes as parameters and a constructor with no parameters (You can add an extra if you want)
	- getters and setters for your attributes
	- 2 generic methods for a vehicle
	- a toString (You can reformat this to make it look nicer)

In your main runner class, then instantiate 4 objects

Inheritance & Polymorphism:

Create 3 sub classes (children classes) of Vehicle, each with 1 or 2 of its own attributes (that are different to the ones in Vehicle)
create a constructor with every attribute (Including parent attributes) in each class
create Getters and setters in each child class
Override the generic methods for vehicle in each child class
Create a toString in each child class (these should include the attributes from Vehicle as well)

In a new class called Garage, create a list of vehicles(empty for now)
Add a method that lets you add a vehicle to the list
create a findVehicleById method to find a vehicle by its id
STRETCH - create a findVehicleByType method to find vehicles based on its type

Exceptions:
Create a custom exception for VehicleNotFoundException and apply to your Garage class on the
findVehicleById method

Abstraction:
Make your vehicle class an abstract class
add 1 abstract method to your vehicle class called calcBill, and add the implementations 
to your children classes on how you want the bill of that class to be calculated
(this will be a way for you to calculate you overall bill based on the type of vehicle)
In the garage class, create a calculateTotalBill method, that goes through your list and adds a cost to each vehicle
depending on the vehicle type

STRETCH - add a method to calculate the bill by id, add a method to remove a vehicle by id, 
add a method to Calculate bill depending on the type of vehicle, and add any other methods you think will improve your garage!

Interfaces:
Create some interfaces that you can implement into your vehicle class and the children classes too
